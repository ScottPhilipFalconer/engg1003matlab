%this code uses the function imfindcircles to define the edge of the circle
%the radius of the circle was previously estimated using imdistline
%this estimated radius was then used in the parameters for imfindcircles
%the area was calculated using pi*r^2
image = imread("T1.png");
[centre, radius] = imfindcircles (image,[12,16], "Sensitivity", 1)
imshow(image);
h = viscircles(centre,radius);
area = pi*(radius*radius)
